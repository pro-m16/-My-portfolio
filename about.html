            <p>My name is Mark Hinds and I am a Web developer from Jamaica,
            where they aren't alot in abundance. So i decided to join
            the lot that are situated here because of the love that I've found for 
            finding creative ways to express myself during coding. I've been coding for over an year now, 
            learning new skills to keep improving and be on of the best of the best.
